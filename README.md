   - Choose connection type (RDP, SSH, Telnet, VNC)
   - Assign device category for better organization
   - Select the credential you created
   - Enter connection name
5. **Start recording macros** with `Ctrl+Shift+F9` to automate repetitive tasks

## 📜 Macro System (New!)

### Record and Play Macros

- **Play**: `Ctrl+Shift+F11` to execute saved macros  
- **Manage**: Access macro library from Quick Actions menu
- **Edit**: Rename, describe, and organize your automation sequences

### Perfect for Automating:
- Complex connection sequences
- Repetitive configuration tasks
- Multi-step diagnostic procedures
- Bulk operations on connections

## 📥📤 Backup & Migration

### Quick Examples

#### Using Repositories
```typescript
import { ConnectionRepository } from './data'

const repository = new ConnectionRepository(context)
const result = await repository.getAll()
if (result.success) {
  console.log('Connections:', result.data)
} else {
  console.error('Error:', result.error)
}
```

#### Creating Commands
```typescript
import { BaseCommand } from './commands/base'

export class MyCommand extends BaseCommand<void, string> {
  async execute(): Promise<Result<string, string>> {
    // Command implementation
    return { success: true, data: 'Command executed' }
  }
}
```
